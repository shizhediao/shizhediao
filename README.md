<h1>Aloha. I'm Shizhe Diao 👋 </h1>

Hello, my name is Shizhe Diao and I am now a final year Master of Philosophy (M.Phil) student at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/home), majoring in Computer Science and supervised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/).
My research focuses on artificial intelligence, mainly in the context of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, I have been doing research on the natural language generation.

Besides programming, I have an immense interest in swimming 🏊, kayaking 🚣, windsurfing :surfer:, dinghy sailing :sailboat:, and stand up paddling!
